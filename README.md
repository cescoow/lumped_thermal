# MATLAB Thermal Toolbox

### April 2024

## Introduction
Created by Francesco Lena in October 2024, this repository hosts MATLAB tools for simulating and analyzing heat transfer in interconnected systems. The toolbox includes two main applications:

1. **View Factor Calculator**: Uses a Monte Carlo ray-tracing method to estimate radiative view factors between surfaces loaded from STL files. This is ideal for studying systems involving radiative heat exchange.
2. **Lumped Elements Thermal Simulation**: Models temperature dynamics in systems of lumped thermal elements, accounting for conduction, radiation, and external heat sources.

These tools are experimental, designed primarily for academic and research use where customization is essential. Users should validate results against other methodologies for comprehensive analysis. For more information, see the project repository at [GitHub - Lumped Thermal](https://github.com/cescoow/lumped_thermal).
